## What are the Reviews of The Souten Full Movie?
 
The Souten full movie has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some have praised the movie for its melodious songs, emotional scenes and performances of the lead actors, especially Rajesh Khanna and Padmini Kolhapure. Others have criticized the movie for its clichÃ©d plot, unrealistic characters and lengthy duration. Here are some of the reviews of The Souten full movie:

- **IMDb**: The Souten full movie has a rating of 6.7 out of 10 on IMDb, based on 5 user reviews. One of the reviewers wrote: \"Hindi musical romance, set on Mauritius, deals with self-made businessman Shyam (Rajesh Khanna) and a love triangle whose other points are spoiled rich girl Ruku (Tina Munim) and wistful Radha (Padmini Kolhapure). The film is well-made and well-acted by all concerned, though I found some of the writing for Munim's character a bit inconsistent. Khanna is solid, and Chopra very effectively underplays his bad guy. Kolhapure, a young teenager when the film was made, gives a highly charismatic performance that makes me want to see a lot more of her work.\"[^1^]
- **Wikipedia**: The Souten full movie has a brief summary on Wikipedia, which states: \"Souten (transl. Co-Wife [or] Husband's other wife) is a 1983 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Saawan Kumar Tak, starring Rajesh Khanna, Tina Munim, Padmini Kolhapure, Prem Chopra and Pran. It was written by Kamleshwar, with music by Usha Khanna. The song \"Shayad Meri Shaadi\" sung by Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar became especially memorable.\"[^2^]
- **Rotten Tomatoes**: The Souten full movie does not have a rating or a consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, but it has one review from an audience member who gave it 3 out of 5 stars. The reviewer wrote: \"The other woman in her man's life. Souten was released in 1983 after Avtaar & went on to become a super hit, paving the way for Rajesh Khanna's comeback. The film is a tear jerker & a bit long for 3 hours but keeps you interested. Tina Munium has done well but Padmini Kolhapure walks away with the honors though why she sheds so much of tears is a mystery.\"[^3^]
